# **About Me**

Hi, my name is **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I graduated in 2017 from the Department of Mathematics at Makassar State University. After graduation, I worked as a private tutor teaching Mathematics and English. My students were from a wide range of ages. Some were students in primary and high schools, while others were college students and even professionals. I also worked in an edutech company as a video maker. Although these jobs are not directly related to data analytics, the experience helps me improve my communication skills.

I wanted to become a data analyst, but at the time, I lacked the skill set to find a job as a data analyst. So, I learned R, Python, and SQL in my free time. I also enrolled in some courses, such as:

1. [**Data engineer**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NZ27zxtIKrJecoUpImcuqhHmPP3v4oIB/view?usp=sharing) (2022), *by **Digitalent Kominfo** in collaboration with **DQLab***
1. [**Data analytics - Fast Track**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1skdwPT5Y-Cj9gt_DUS0C5iPz1-0qZpro/view?usp=sharing) (2022), *by **Digitalent Kominfo** in collaboration with **DQLab***

In 2020, I enrolled in a master's program in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at IPB University. Pursuing this master's degree is not only helping me solidify my theoretical knowledge but also helping me in practical knowledge since the practical classes, which took about half of the program, were based on real-world cases.
