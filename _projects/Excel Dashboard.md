In 2020, I had a side job as a video maker (VM). Our team consisted of 50+ VMs which, in total, could make hundreds of videos per week. Each video went through quality control processes before it could be accepted or rejected and needed to be revised. Therefore, our management team made a tracking system using Google Sheets so that each VMs could access their given tasks and track the progress of their submissions. The system, however, quickly became less efficient since the data exponentially increased as the project progressed. The system was so hard to access at one point that it decreased my productivity.

I made this personal tracking system and ran it locally to improve my productivity. I only needed to download the team spreadsheet once or twice a week in csv format. This way, I could avoid the lag caused by simultaneous access. Moreover, the csv format removes all formatting I did not use, massively reducing the file size and accelerating the workflow. I then used this csv to update my personal system to track my weekly submissions. I also added a simple dashboard to track my task, payment, and productivity.

Having a personal system significantly improved my productivity. I could spend more time making videos instead of waiting to access the team system. I also could get a glance at how many tasks I had and how productive I was during the week, an insight that was hard to get before this personal tracking system. As a result, I could improve my video production by up to twice my previous production, especially toward the half end of the project.

I also learned and used some Excel skills, some of which are:
1. Macro
1. Pivot table
1. Power Pivot
1. Conditional highlight
1. Date management
1. Excel table
1. Formula
